Reverse Pacman
	- you play as four snakes trying to catch a mouse
	- you have 1 d-pad to move the head of the snake and 1 d-pad to choose which snake to control
	- the mouse moves away from the snakes
	- catch the mouse to win
	- fastest time / least moves wins more
	
	Variants
	- change layout
	- change mouse behavior
	- multiple mouse
	
	Optional
	- snakes have maximum length
	- snakes only catch mouse with their head
	- realtime or turn based

Defragmentation Tetris
	- you play Tetris with colored blocks
	- finished rows do not disappear
	- you play until all blocks are placed or blocks cannot be placed anymore
	- your score is the number of colored groups and empty spaces (lower score is better)
	- you win when your score is below a certain bar
	- you win more when your score is even lower
	
	Optional
	- blocks are generated by cutting up a filled and colored grid
	- the more colors are on this inital grid the harder
	- the bigger the pieces the harder
	- the fuller the grid relative to the playing field the harder
	
Heat Managment
	- you control a character 2d topdown
	- you can place a limited number of fans
	- there is a temperature simulation running
	- you are tasked with resolving a list of tasks involving different sets of computer hardware
	- performing this tasks produces heat
	- if a piece of hardware gets to hot it breaks
	- you win by performing all tasks without breaking anything
	- you win more when you can do it faster
	
	Variants
	- different level layouts
	- different tasks
	
	Optional
	- performing tasks could be just clicking on a tasked
	  OR bringing the tasks to the hardware
	- your character might not sustain big heat for long either
	- hardware should not become to cold either

Jump Prediction
	- the gameworld follows strict deterministic rules
	- you are shown a scenario for a short amount of time
	- you are tasked with predicting the outcome
	- you win if your prediction rate is higher than a threshold
	- you win more if it is even highter and/or you are faster
	
	Variants
	- more complex situations
	- less time before prediction is needed
	
Storage Managment
	- 2d top down grid
	- you are tasked with storing and retrieving tetris like blocks
	- you can posess a shape in order to move or rotate it
	- you win when you fullfill all store and retrieve orders in time
	- you win more if you are even faster or need fewer moves
	
Pattern Matching
	- you have an n x n grid with cells you can manipulate by click
	- you have an objective to achive
	- after you are done setting your pattern the pattern is extended to infinity
	- you win if you still achive the objective on an infinite grid
	- you win more if you took less manipulations
	
	Variants
	- different grid sizes
	- different objectives
